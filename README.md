Agda code to show the profunctor-based arrow definition satisfies the
arrow laws that does not involve `first`. The primal goal of the
implementation is for me to understand Proposition 4.2 in the
following paper: 

B. Jacobs, C. Heunen, and I. Hasuo: Categorical Semantics for Arrows,
JFP 19(3-4), 2009. pp. 403-438.

This repository is just for my studying purpose, and includes a lot of 
reinvention of the wheel. In `Category.agda`, I borrowed or paraphrased 
some code and ideas from the library https://github.com/agda/agda-categories.

This is the reason why this repos's LICENSE refers to "Agda Github Community", 
the copyright holder of the agda-categories library.
