Agda code to show the profunctor-based arrow definition satisfies the
arrow laws that does not involve `first`. The primal goal of the
implementation is for me to understand Proposition 4.2 in the
following paper: 

B. Jacobs, C. Heunen, and I. Hasuo: Categorical Semantics for Arrows,
JFP 19(3-4), 2009. pp. 403-438.

A substantial amount of code in `Category.agda` is borrowed or
paraphrased from Jacques Carette's library
https://github.com/agda/agda-categories.
